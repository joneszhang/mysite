First, you can finish transfers and payment via this app. We support two kinds of payment, one is the most primitive one- input the card number and amount and we will submit this order to the bank. The other one is P2P payment, for which we use GPS to locate orders around you identified by the password you have known from another person. This P2P payment also supports "go Dutch". If the receiveing side start a "go Dutch" order, numerous people will be able to enter the ordre and our app will intelligently calculate the average amount.</p><p>Besides this basic function, we also did some innovating work in details. For example, the app allows you to pay for one order with 2 card if none of your card contains enough money and the quota of each card has been calculated intelligently according to its bank. In addition, we added the social module, in which you can add friends and set their authority so that only people you trust can see your card information and people of the highest priority can see your card number and ask you to pay for their bill.</p>

Then we find that there are many points that can be improved so we participated the IBM Mainframe Technology and Skiils Application 2013 National Campus Contest Team Competition. During which we transplanted our server from http to mainframe and optimized our logic. Finally we won the third prize of the competition. For most of us it's the first time to build such a complex project and many techniques were stranger to us, which means we can only learning by doing and to keep high efficiency we had to work more than 12 hours a day. But our passion finally brought us a good result, it was a perfect team work experience.</p>

	    	<h3>What's special</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Image title"></a><p>As only a group of student, we had no right to access data from banks as Alipay did. So we can only build a virtual bank system by ourselves. We wrote a script to create 20 thousand of records which contains virtual information of name, ID card numbers, bank card numbers and so on. Also, we built our own database to solve the information of our users. All payment operations are solved in server. The data that to be transfered are all encripted by MD5(regarded to be safe at that time) and we add functions like SSO to guarantee the safety of users' accounts.</p><p>The design of payment algorithm was also difficult. To decide which card to use, we should compare the balance, special offer of different banks and user's habit. If it concerns about "go Dutch", we need to dynamically calculate the average amount and choose the best card for receiver to eliminate the poundage.</p><p>Besides, after we entered the IBM contest, we transplanted our server to a mainframe, which was erected in Dalian and we can only work on it via remote connection. And thanks to the course Introduction of Mainframe, we got a lot of guidiance from our teacher, an engineer with more than 30 years of mainframe based development.</p>

	    	<h3>Android!</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg" class="floatleft" alt="Image title"></a><p>Before this project, I knew little about android based development, which means quiet large amount of knowlege waits to be absorbed before I started programming. So before our programming work started I downloaded 2GB of learning material and read everyday. Hard as I've tried, my progress of learning still can't meet the demands of the project, so I can only learn by doing. And in only just 3 weeks I learned and applied SQLITE, Sharedpreference and 4 basic tools of andoird like Intent and Broadcast.<p>Finally I applied the local database with both Sqlite and sharedpreference. Every time users enter the app I'll ask server for updated information, if it failed, I will show the information stored in the local database, which will still help the user. For the UI, I used relative layout, which means my front end could fit most intelligent phones today. Also, I've learned a lot about the application of View library of andoird and implemented a completed front end with visual effects like gallery and 3D Rotation. Also, to contact with the server, I add child threads to solve the transfer work so that the ui could keep smooth when connecting to the server. Also, with the help of intent and broadcast, I implemented the GPS locating and sent shortmessage automatically.</p>

	    	<h3>UI Design</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Image title"></a><p>For the first time, I got involved in UI design, which was pretty hard for a guy with no design experiece. But I really admired designer's work and had was willing to start from scratch. So for about 15 days I practiced my PS skill and design ability via imitated existed works. I modified my design again and again and fianlly identified the sytle of our homepage. Then in about one week I finished all design pictures with the help of Fan zikun, he was really a gifted guy of design. I really admire flatterning and thanks to this experience, I learned a lot about color schemes and interactive design. It's very pround a thing to see the front-end I implemented running in numerous of mobile phones.</p>
