    	<div class="span8">
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_1.jpg" class="floatleft" alt="Image title"></a><P>This summer, I entered Transmension Tech, Shanghai as an intern of game development. After 15 days of traning, the first project of my employee life came to me and and its difficulty really can match its special meaning.</p><p>Gem is a Tile-matching video game developed based on SexyFramework(A game engine created by Popcap), with the powerful cross-tools developed by our company, it can run on many different platforms. Combined with Chinese history story, this game has been released in the Republic of China and Taiwan.</p>

	    	<h3>My Task</h3>
	    	 <p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_1.jpg" class="floatleft" alt="Image title"></a><p>My task is to optimize this game so that it can run on a very old STB named Mod205, which have come into market more than 14 years(But it's now still at work in over one million families). But gem was built last year and although it's a ligeweight game, it's requirement for environment still largely excess what Mod205 can offer.</p><p>As this picture shows, the STB offers less thant 10MB room for texture memory and only 20+ room for memory. Besides, due to its age, the condition of cpu really is doutful. For the worst one I've met, its throughput is so poor that it will dump when more than 2MB data is converted into graphics card. Which means that I not only need to compress the space it requests. I also have to control the amount of data that is transported at once.</p>
    	
	    	<div class="hr_pattern"></div>

	    	<h3>My Strategy</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Image title"></a><p>The main function we've implemented was the interaciton with a virtual ball. Thanks to Kinect sdk, it was not so difficult to catch and draw people's body on the screen. What really had afflicted me was how to simulate the motion and collision effect in real world.</p><p>To finish this algorithm, I reviewed a lot of geometry knowledge, including some triangular geometry equalities. I also imported the polar coordinates to help set certain value and finish calculation.</p><p>Another difficulty was that in computer, update is incontinuous in time, which means that if the speed of the ball or human body was too fast, the next time computer update the position data, the ball may totally have passed through the body, leading to bugs. To fix this problem. I took all posible conditions into account and dealt with them respectively. About six main conditions was listed in the picture by side.</p>

	    	<h3>Cool tools!</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Image title"></a><p>This game was built as a project on Visual studio, and besides original codes,  many parts was built based on existing tools as follow.<br />Microsoft XNA SDK, the official tools for kinect development, is highly packaged and easy to use. The stream of skeleton and color image was offered, digging and analyse data from which can help me control the status of user.<br/ > Microsoft XNA, a game development system, offers the basic function of graphic API like vertex drawing and model disposal, which means I many extra works have to be done by myself.<br />C#. the whole programming work was done via C#, and some library offered by .NET Framework. </p>

	    	<h3>Air mouse vs GestOpt</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg" class="floatleft" alt="Image title"></a><p>Based on kinect, there is no input source but the motion of user, which requires new conception of UI design and implements. And in line with tips from some books, I implemented the air mouse and accordingly designed some float button as the basic of control.<br />Take use of Kinect SDK, I can the position of user's hand in real time and drew it on the screen synchronously.</p><p>GestOpt is another part of my UI design. By catching the position of various joints(like hand, head, wrist, elbow,etc) and checking their state according to the DFA that was previously designed, We can get to know what kind of action the user is doing and so that feedback accordingly. As the video shows, we can handle gestures like waving around. Our guidiance interface was implemented by this function.</p>

	    	<h3>Really a tough work</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/content/744/content_11.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/content/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg" class="floatleft" alt="Image title"></a><p>For 5 months, more than 10000 lines of codes and thousands words of documents I wrote, For many weekends I stayed in our lab until midnight alone. Although unfortunately I failed to won a prize, I've never regreted because this game, so fascinating and amazing, deserves my payment.</p><p>Highly thankful for people who have offered their support. Especially my dear team members and my teacher Ms.Yao, who offered me Kinect and many technical help.</p>
