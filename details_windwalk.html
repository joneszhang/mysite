    	<div>
            <P>The end of summer, 2013, heard about my ability of design and implementing front-end of android. An entrepreneur team invited me to join them and develop a new front-end for their team. I was quiet busy that time for my contest but I was extremely interested in how entrepreneurs work so I entered them and work as the member of research and development department. For about three months I finsihed designing UI and implemented the front-end based on Android by myself. Although finally the team failed and I really appreciate this experience cause it had taught me a lot.</p>
	    	
	    	<div class="hr_pattern"></div>

	    	<h3>Madai Tech</h3>
	    	 <p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/windwalk/contents/meeting.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/windwalk/cuts/meeting.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Image title"></a><p>This is a entrepreneur team consits of students from sophomore to senior and even some people who have already graduated. They originally gathered together to finish a research program named fall prevention system for elder, During which they realized the great future of wearable devices and decided to launch a company named Madai Tech specialized in designing wearable devices and corollary Mobile App. When I joined them they had just started development work and in great needs for coders.</p>
    	
	    	<div class="hr_pattern"></div>

	    	<h3>Intelligent insole</h3>
	    	<p><a class="object" data-hover="icon-zoom-mini" href="img/windwalk/contents/insole.jpg" data-rel="gallery[projects1]"><img src="img/windwalk/cuts/insole.jpg" class="floatleft" alt="Image title"></a><p>Via insert a microcontroller inside an insole, we get a new wearable device. Looks like it's quiet simple, but quiet large amount of work has been done. First we did a lot of research before deciding where to put the microcontroller and finally decided to insert it in the center of insole so that when people wear shoes it will be under the foot arch and the archy room will help protect the microcontroller from being grinded to broken. Second, the communication between microcontroller and mobile phone was another difficulty. We chose bluetooth to solve this problem and the bluetooth development based on microcontroller was really difficult. We carefully researched the Bluetooth protocol and wrote a whole module for bluetooth communication. And finally, we build an android App for users to control the insole and help manage their health condition. We also build a website for the promotion of our products.</p>

 	    	<div class="hr_pattern"></div>

	    	<h3>New aproach to fit screen</h3>
	    	</a><p>In the last android project, my work was largely limited by andoird's xml system and to reach some effects many zigzaggery needed to be taken, which really had undermined my efficient. So when another project came to me, I considered to take another strategy, I decided to dynamically buil the construction of views, which mean all the layers will be defined via java but not xml files. And via calculating the ratio previously and getting the screen size by the android sdk, so that the whole interface will dynamically adpat to almost all different screens.</p><p>Besides, the fundamental widgets offered by android can't meet my demands anymore. So I started to write my own DIY widget via implementing and overwrite methods of View class. And finally creat very intersting widgets mysefl. Especially, just as the picutre shows, I rewrite the list widget and implement a kind of list that only shows the chosen unit and will shows other members only when the list is focused. Besides, it supports recycling shows. To implement them, I did a lot of research on how View works and did a lot of work to design the drawing path on canvas. Besides, the update problem is also difficult and I finally resolved it via creating an extra list to manage their update and draw.</p>

	    	<h3>UI Design</h3>
        <p>This is the second time I design UI, but it's the first time for a commercialized product. So I have to try my best to, at least, meet the demands of the marketing team. And after three versions of modification I finally ensured the UI design. I have to promise that it's still a amateur shot. But I had tried my best for it and enjoyed the process of creating. That's me, I will try anything interesting no matter what what it can pay back and how difficult it was. Here are parts of my design drawing and if you wants to know more and see the animation effects I've implemented, please don't hesitate to download the demo apk for UI I attached below.</p>
        <ul class="tabs clearfix">
          <li><a href="#one" class="default-tab">first version</a></li>
          <li><a href="#two">final version</a></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tabs-content">
          <div id="one">
            <p>the first version. Take reference of IOS and use two hues, gray and pink, respectively for boys and girls. To design this I've researched at least 10 different examples. This UI is designed based on the idea of card and drawer, with style of flattening.</p>
